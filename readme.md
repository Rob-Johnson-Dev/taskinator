# Taskinator

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple task list using html, bootstrap, and javascript.
You can add items, mark them as complete or not, and delete them when done.
This project should...

-   Implement responsive design to ensure the application is usable across different devices and screen sizes.
-   Ensure accessibility best practices are followed, such as semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes.
-   Implement validation for task inputs (e.g., prevent empty tasks from being added).

## Setup

Simply copy all project files into a folder and load the "index.html" file into a browser window.

## Overview

This page uses local storage to save the task list and the current drop-down value.  If you load the page and nothing is stored (this will be the case the first time the page is loaded) you will be asked if you want to add some test data.  You can choose to do so or you can start with a blank slate and add your own tasks.

To view and/or delete keys from local storage, in most browsers you can press F12 to bring up developer tools and then look for "Application" (Chrome/Edge) or "Storage" (Firefox) and you should see "Local Storage."  If you do not see it, search for "how to access local storage in ..." for your browser.

## Tools used
